### **Overview**
The Spaceship Titanic competition challenges participants to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension. This project aims to solve this classification problem using machine learning models and evaluated their performance based on classification accuracy.

### **Data Loading and Exploration**

### **Data Preprocessing**
1. Handle missing values by filling with median or mode values.
2. Create new features by splitting the 'Cabin' column.
3. Encode categorical variables.

### **Model Training and Evaluation**
1. Train multiple models (RandomForest, GradientBoosting, KNeighbors, DecisionTree) with hyperparameter tuning.
2. Evaluate models using cross-validation.
3. Ensemble models using VotingClassifier.

### **Feature Importance**
Identify important features from the best model.   

### **Test Data Preparation and Prediction**
Prepare test data similarly to training data and make predictions.
